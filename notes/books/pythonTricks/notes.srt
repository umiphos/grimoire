```python

from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def managed_file(name):
    try:
        f = open(name, 'w')
        yield f
    finally:
    f.close()

with managed_file('hello.txt') as f:
    f.write('hello, world')
    f.write('by now')
```

The example using the context manager will close at the end of the with statement, meaning that it will receive all the writes thanks to yield.
