Understanding div
====================


There is not much to explain, we are just starting to really understand the
div over tables. Div, is a label for containing information, but it can be
edited to be certain size or to have specifications with style.

```xml
<div class="parent" style="overflow:auto;">
    <div class="left" style="float: left;width: 33%;">left</div>
    <div class="center" style="float: left;width: 33%;">center</div>
    <div class="right" style="float: left;width: 33%;">right</div>
</div>
```

The overflow will tell us that the divs inside will re arrange themselfs.
If we put a % of a third they will be always in the specific amount.
