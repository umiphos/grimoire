### Readmefile

This repository is a way to interact with a future version of me that is searching for answers to questions that we have found.
This is a grimoire...daaam that's how I will call this repository, "umiphos/grimoire" that sounds cool, as you can see this was a revelation of the name to this repo, and comments like this are going to be all around in several files, stay tune, take note and learn from ```Arturo of the paste``` 
and if you have a better or a new idea, please contribute to this humble repo.
