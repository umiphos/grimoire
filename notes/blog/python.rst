Environment variables
=====================

In order to set or read variables with python we need to use, **os.environ** . The behaviour of environ is to use the variables as a dictionary.

os.environment.has_key('HAS_IT') # if the key HAS_IT exists


Checking the envelope of a request
==================================
/.repo_requirements/virtualenv/python2.7/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pysimplesoap/client.py(276)call()

at that point you should have a valid self.xml_request that will have the envelope right for your request.
